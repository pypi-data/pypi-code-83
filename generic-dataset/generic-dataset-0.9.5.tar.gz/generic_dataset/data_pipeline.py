    This class constructs a pipeline to elaborate a numpy.ndarray.
    A pipeline can be executed using the CPU or the GPU (using CuPy). This can be specified in the run method
    A pipeline is composed by a series of consecutive operations performed iteratively to the same data.
    Before running a pipeline, a pipeline must be correctly configure it using the following methods:
    - set_data(): this method sets the data to elaborate
    - set_end_function(): this method sets the end-function, which can be defined by the programmer.
    - add_operation(): this method adds an operation to the pipeline.
    This configuration must be performed before calling run() method, otherwise an exception is raised.
    A pipeline cannot be re-run (so don't call run() twice)
    A series of operation can be set for each pipeline: they are iteratively executed using the initial data when run() method is called.
    The programmer can add an operation using add_operation() method.
